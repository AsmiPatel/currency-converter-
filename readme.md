#currency-converter

Convert between a few currencies and euros on your Android phone, as easily as possible. See the GitHub page for more details.

The code was originally written in Kotlin but has now been converted to Kotlin. The Java code before the conversion is still available in the master branch.

#Currency rates

The currency rates are fetched from the Free Currency Converter API.

Now when you registered there and got API_KEY you got a json link where you have all currencies. So how I work with this json. For this I used Retrofit API.
